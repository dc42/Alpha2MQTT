Changes in DC42 fork of Alpha2MQTT
==================================

This version differs from the original from dxoverdy as follows:

- Changed to run on ESP32 Devkit V1 as well as the original ESP8266. When running on ESP32 it uses hardware serial port Serial2 instead of software serial. [dxoverdy has now added ESP32 support too.]
- Until a RS485 connection is established (by successfully fetching the serial number), it iterates through multiple baud rates to try to get a connection. This seems to be necessary to connect to my SMILE5 inverter.
- Removed the heartbeat code because it isn't needed (by my SMILE5 at least)
- Cleaned up the code to remove compiler warnings and possible buffer overflows if bad data is received

Wiring when using ESP32 Devkit:

Display SDA -> GPIO22 aka D22
Display SCL -> GPIO21 aka D21
RS485 transmit control (if needed by the RS485 module) -> GPIO5 aka D5
RS485 DIN (data to transmit to RS485, misleadingly called RxD on the red RS485 modules) -> GPIO17 aka TX2
RS485 RD (data received from RS485, misleadingly called TxD on the red RS485 modules) -> GPIO16 aka RX2

For a SMILE5 inverter the RS485 connections on the RJ45 CAN/RS485 socket are as follows:

Pin 3 RS485 COM (connect to COM on the RS485 module, or ground of the Alpha2MQTT if COM is not provided)
Pin 4 RS485 B
Pin 4 RS485 A

Leave all other pins not connected (pins 2 and 6 are CAN).
